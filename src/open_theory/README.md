OpenTheory for ProofPower
=========================

This is a very experimental implementation of an OpenTheory Reader and
Writer for ProofPower. It needs ProofPower 3.1w1 or later. The writer
targets OpenTheory draft version 6. The Reader should be able to input
any OpenTheory version 5 or later.

See the
[OpenTheory Project web site](http://www.gilith.com/research/opentheory/)
for more information about OpenTheory.

Use the make file opentheory.mkf to process the scripts.
For instructions on how to do this type:

make -f opentheory.mkf

and you will be given some help on using the make file.
