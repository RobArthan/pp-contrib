\section{Introduction}\label{Intro}

This note is the second in a planned series concerned with specification via
pre- and post-conditions in a partial correctness setting.
It applies the general notion of specification and refinement given in the first note in the series
to give a notion of correctness for a simple imperative programming language, where
programs and program fragments may be equipped with Floyd-Hoare style specification annotations.

In the sequel, we present a simple formal model in {\ProductZ}
of a refinement notation comprising a miniature, but complete, imperative
programming language annotated with formal specifications;
the semantics of that programming language and the notion
of correctness relative to the specification annotations is defined.
A semantic model of a verification condition generator (or pre-condition
calculator) is given which can be proved to be sound with respect both to
the programming language semantics and to the intensional semantics of
the specification annotations.

\Hide{
The following ML sets up a context for giving the {\ProductZ} specifications.
=SML
open_theory"refcalc";
set_pc"z_library1";
force_delete_theory"preccalc" handle Fail _ => ();
new_theory"preccalc";
=TEX
}

The Z specification uses infix notation for the following relation
and function symbols (in addition to those defined in the first note):
πZ
‹ rel  _ %models% _, _ ‚ _
∞
πZ
‹ fun 7 _ íâ* _, _ Åâ* _
∞

The specification contains a number of conjectures. All of these
have been proved with {\Product} and the resulting theory listing
is included as an appendix to this document. An index to the Z specification
is given at the end of the document.

Please note this is work-in-progress and the current version of
this note lacks any serious attempt to cite the literature or
compare the results with other work. Cousot's article on
program verification in the Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science
gives an appropriate survey but tends to veer towards the theoretical.
In particular, completeness results are not particularly relevant in
practical applications --- they just give you warm feelings that if
you give sufficiently strong specifications,
you will get weakest, rather than just sufficient pre-conditions.
The relational semantics given here goes back at least as far as early
work of Hoare.




\section{States and State Transformers}\label{STATE}
The internal structure of states is not relevant to our purposes.
For a conventional imperative programming language, the states will be
assignments of values to program variables.
We just introduce a given set to represent the states:
πZ
‹ [€STATE›]
∞

The commands in our programming language will denote
{\em state transformers}. A state transformer is just a relation on states:
πZ
‹ €STATE_TRANSFORMER› ¶ STATE ™ STATE
∞
{\raggedright
We think of a state transformer $t$ as {\em responding} to a state, the {\em before-state},
$s$ in its domain by non-deterministically selecting some {\em response} or {\em after-state},
which is a state $s'$ such that $(s, s') \in t$.

}

\section{Predicates and Specifications}\label{PRED}

We instantiate the notions of predicates, pre- post-conditions
and specifications from the first document in the series:

πZ
‹ €P_PRED› ¶ PRED[STATE]
∞
πZ
‹ €P_PRE_COND› ¶ PRE_COND[STATE]
∞
πZ
‹ €P_POST_COND› ¶ POST_COND[STATE, STATE]
∞
πZ
‹ €P_SPEC› ¶ SPEC[STATE, STATE]
∞



\section{Programs}\label{PROG}
Our notion of program has five syntactic categories:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{4in}|}\hline
Atom &
Some set of primitive operations on the state.
\\\hline
Seq &
Sequential composition
\\\hline
If &
If-then-else
\\\hline
While &
While-loop
\\\hline
Spec &
Programs with specification annotations
\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{center}


The following free type gives the abstract syntax of programs, in which we
mingle semantic and syntactic concepts to simplify later work. We also use a tree
structure rather than a linear list for sequential composition, since that is semantically
harmless, and, again, helps to keep things simple later on.

πZ
‹ €PROG› ::=
‹	€Atom› (STATE_TRANSFORMER)
‹ |	€Seq› (PROG ∏ PROG)
‹ |	€If› (P_PRED ∏ PROG ∏ PROG)
‹ |	€While› (P_PRED ∏ PROG)
‹ |	€Spec› (P_SPEC ∏ PROG)
∞
In a typical imperative language, the atoms might be the denotations of assignment statements and procedure calls. In the Compliance Notation, the denotation of a procedure
call is effectively represented by an instance of the formal specification appearing
in the procedure header.


The following function gives the semantics of this notion of a program.
The semantic value of a program is a state transformer.
In the semantics, the specification annotations are just
ignored --- it is the actual code that determines the semantics, not our aspirations
for it.
πZAX
‹ €semantics› : PROG ≠ STATE_TRANSFORMER
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ µt : STATE_TRANSFORMER; pâ1, pâ2 : PROG; c : P_PRED; s : P_SPEC∑
‹	semantics (Atom t) = t
‹ ±	semantics (Seq(pâ1, pâ2)) = semantics pâ1 ª semantics pâ2
‹ ±	semantics (If(c, pâ1, pâ2)) = (c Ú semantics pâ1) ¿ (c · semantics pâ2)
‹ ±	semantics (While(c, pâ1)) = (c Ú semantics pâ1)Á*Í Å c
‹ ±	semantics (Spec(s, pâ1)) = semantics pâ1
∞
It is in the above that the convenience of dealing with partial correctness
begins to become apparent. The semantic equation for a while-loop says that the
body of the loop is to be executed repeatedly in states satisfying
the predicate $c$ until a state which does not satisfy $c$ is reached.
If this fails to terminate the result is just the empty relation:
we are under no obligation to assign any more complex notion of meaning
to the non-terminating execution.

The partial semantics also embraces in an abstract way the possibility
of the program failing gracefully. Throughout the sequel, when we talk
about non-termination, we include the possibility that via some
exception-raising mechanism that is outside the scope of the present model,
execution of a command may result in some kind of abnormal termination
which is handled properly in the physical environment in which the program
is executed.

As a simple check on our definitions and to give a first exercise
in reasoning by induction over the syntax of programs, let us
state as a conjecture the claim that the function on programs
which simply strips out all the specifications is semantics-preserving:
πZ
‹ strip_specs_cnj ?Ù
‹	µ	strip_specs: PROG ≠ PROG
‹	|	µt : STATE_TRANSFORMER; pâ1, pâ2 : PROG; c : P_PRED; s : SPEC∑
‹		strip_specs (Atom t) = (Atom t)
‹	 ±	strip_specs (Seq(pâ1, pâ2)) = Seq(strip_specs pâ1, strip_specs pâ2)
‹	 ±	strip_specs (If(c, pâ1, pâ2)) = If(c, strip_specs pâ1, strip_specs pâ2)
‹	 ±	strip_specs (While(c, pâ1)) = While(c, strip_specs pâ1)
‹	 ±	strip_specs (Spec(s, pâ1)) = strip_specs pâ1
‹	∑ µp : PROG∑ semantics(strip_specs p) = semantics p
∞


\section{Program Correctness}\label{sat}
For a program to be correct every part of it that has a specification
must certainly satisfy that specification, which in our setting means that
the semantic value of the program must be a refinement of the given specification annotation.
We write
=INLINEFT
p %models% s
=TEX
\ to mean that program $p$ satisfies specification $s$.
πZAX
‹ €_ %models% _› : PROG ™ SPEC
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ µ prog : PROG; prec : P_PRE_COND; postc : P_POST_COND ∑
‹	prog %models% (prec, postc) § (prec, postc) √ (prec, semantics prog)
∞

However, a good intuitive notion of
correctness also requires the pre-condition of each specification
in the program to be satisfied whenever the relevant part of the program
is executed. For example, every part of 
a program that has a specification might satisfy its specification, but,
the program might still include a reachable specification with an empty
post-condition: clearly, this part of the program is
``correct, but for the wrong reasons''.

For the want of a better name,
if $p$ is a program and $c$ is a set of states,
we will say that $p$ is {\em upright} on $c$
iff. no pre-condition in $p$ will be violated when $p$ is executed in
a starting state in $c$.
We write $p \perp c$ when this holds.


πZAX
‹ €_ ‚ _› : PROG ™ PRED
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ µt : STATE_TRANSFORMER; postc : P_POST_COND; pâ1, pâ2 : PROG;
‹  câ1, câ2, prec : P_PRE_COND∑
‹	((Atom t) ‚ câ1)
‹ ±	((Seq(pâ1, pâ2) ‚ câ1) § pâ1 ‚ câ1 ± pâ2 ‚ semantics pâ1 ®câ1©)

‹ ±	((Spec((prec, postc), pâ1) ‚ câ1) § (câ1 Ä prec ± pâ1 ‚ câ1))
∞
Uprightness enjoys the following two useful properties:
πZ
‹ upright_mono_cnj ?Ù
‹	µ prog : PROG; câ1, câ2 : P_PRED∑
‹		prog ‚ câ1 ± câ2 Ä câ1 ¥ prog ‚ câ2

\section{Pre-condition Calculation}\label{PREC_CALC}
The simplest view of a pre-condition calculator 
would be a predicate transformer: a function that takes a program and a 
post-condition given as a predicate on the final state as
its argument and returns a predicate that, we hope, gives a pre-condition
which will guarantee achievement of the post-condition.

When one looks into the details of defining a useful pre-condition calculator
one finds that it is really has to be a post-condition transformer: in order to
give an algorithm that works by recursion over the structure of a program,
one must work with post-conditions, i.e., relations on states, rather than
just states. The domain of all these relations corresponds
to an appropriate initial or intermediate
program state throughout the calculation. The calculation
essentially works backwards through the program reversing the effects
of program execution. 
πZ
‹ €PREC_CALC› ¶ PROG ∏ P_POST_COND ≠ P_POST_COND
∞
In the simple view as a predicate transformer,
a pre-condition calculator would be
sound if the pre-condition it returns
for any program and post-condition is such that execution
of the program subject to the pre-condition refines the specification
statement formed from the returned pre-condition and the given post-condition.
In the post-condition transformer view that we are taking,
our soundness criterion is formalised in the following definition which will
ensure that pre-condition calculation interacts nicely with sequential composition.

πZAX
‹ €sound_prec_calc› : PREC_CALC
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ µpc : PREC_CALC∑
‹	pc ç sound_prec_calc
‹ §	(µprog : PROG; postc, postc' : P_POST_COND
‹	|	postc = pc(prog, postc')
‹	∑	(dom postc, postc') √ (dom postc, postc ª semantics prog))
∞
When one has completed the pre-condition
calculation both the domain and the range of the resulting relation now correspond to the
initial program state as well, and one may extract the desired post-condition
by intersecting with the identity relation.
Using this idea, we can formulate, the (not very deep) conjecture that
if the program has a specification at the top level and if the calculated
pre-condition contains the pre-condition of the specification, then
the program satisfies the specification:
πZ
‹ prec_calc_sat_cnj ?Ù
‹	µ pc : PREC_CALC; c_prec, s_prec: P_PRE_COND;
‹	  s_postc : P_POST_COND; p : PROG
‹	|	pc ç sound_prec_calc
‹	±	c_prec = dom (pc(Spec((s_prec, s_postc), p), s_postc) ° (id STATE))
‹	±	s_prec Ä c_prec
‹	∑	p %models% (s_prec, s_postc)
∞

We can easily exhibit a sound but not at all useful, pre-condition calculator,
which simply offers the empty set as a pre-condition which will achieve
any desired post-condition:
πZ
‹ trivial_prec_calc_sound_cnj ?Ù
‹	µ pc : PREC_CALC
‹	|	µprog : PROG; postc : P_POST_COND∑ pc (prog, postc) = ö
‹	∑	pc ç sound_prec_calc
∞

We will now give a model of a more useful pre-condition calculator.
There are some preliminaries to take care of:
the treatment of if-then-else is made more readable using the
following two variants on the theme of range restriction and
range anti-restriction:
ù[X, Y]úúúúúúúúúúúúúúúú
‹ _ €íâ*› _ : (X ™ Y) ∏ Y ≠ (X ™ Y);
‹ _ €Åâ*› _ : (X ™ Y) ∏ Y ≠ (X ™ Y)
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹µ R : X ™ Y; T :  Y ∑
‹	R íâ* T = {x : X; y : Y | (x, y) ç R ± (µz : Y | (x, z) ç R ∑ z ç T)} ;
‹µ R : X ™ Y; T :  Y ∑
‹	R Åâ* T = {x : X; y : Y | (x, y) ç R ± (µz : Y | (x, z) ç R ∑ z é T)}
à¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
The useful pre-condition calculator will use a heuristic to propose
a specification for the body of a while-loop.
The soundness of the pre-condition calculator is independent of
the heuristic --- it has to be, because as the following
loose specification shows, one possibility is that the
specification is just lifted from the program without further analysis.
πZAX
‹ €guess_spec› : PROG ≠ P_SPEC
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ µs : P_SPEC; p : PROG ∑ guess_spec(Spec(s, p)) = s
∞

With the preliminaries in place,
we can now define the useful pre-condition calculator, which
we think of as pulling a post-condition backwards through a program
transforming it as we go.
In the definition, the various syntactic categories are dealt with as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
A post-condition is pulled back through an atomic statement, by
calculating the set of pairs $(s, s')$ such that the response
of the atom on $s'$ is a response permitted by the post-condition on $s$.
\item
A post-condition is pulled back through the sequential composition
of
$p_1$ and $p_2$ in the obvious way: pull it back through $p_2$ and
then pull the result back through $p_1$.
\item
A post-condition is pulled back through an if-then-else statement
by pulling it back through the then- and else-parts of the statement.
The overall result is then the union of these intermediate results after discarding
all transitions which do not unambiguously belong to the if-part
or the else-part.
\item
A post-condition is pulled back through a while loop by applying
the heuristic to guess a specification for the body of the loop.
The overall result is formed as a union of two parts.

The first part of the union
corresponds to states where the body of the loop is never
execute and is just the appropriate restriction of the original
post-condition.

The second part corresponds to states where the body of the loop
is executed at least once and is given as a set comprehension below.
The set comprehension is empty unless three conditions
are satisfied: {\em(i)} the condition of the while-loop must
denote a set of states that are included in the guessed pre-condition;
{\em(ii)} the pre-condition of the body must denote
a set of states that satisfy the pre-condition resulting from
pulling the guessed post-condition back through the body;
and {\em(iii)} for each state satisfying the guessed pre-condition,
the set of all states allowed by the guessed post-condition in
response to this state which do not satisfy the loop condition must
be contained in every possible response of the original post-condition.

\item
A post-condition is pulled back through a specification statement
in much the same way as it is pulled back through an atomic
statement treating the post-condition of the specification statement
in the same way as the state transformer of the atom.
The result is then filtered to remove all state transitions which
do not unambiguously satisfy both the pre-condition of the
specification statement and the pre-condition calculated from
the body of the specification statement.
\end{itemize}

Before stating some conjectures about the properties of the useful
pre-condition calculator, some remarks about the definition and
how it is actually realised in a practical system are in order.

A practical implementation can represent the post-condition being
transformed as (the conceptual conjunction of)
a finite set of syntactic predicates ${\cal P}_i(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x})$,
where $\vec{x}$ represents some list of program variables and
$\vec{x_0}$ represents a list of program variables decorated to
distinguish them as initial variables (i.e., they refer to the before-state
of the code being analysed).
The pre-condition calculator will operate by syntactic transformations
on these predicates which hold the initial variables fixed but may
make substitutions to $\vec{x}$.
At the beginning of the calculation, $\vec{x}$ refers to the final
state of the program, and as the calculation works backwards through
the code, the execution state referred to by $\vec{x}$ moves backwards in step.

The most primitive state-changing operation will be the atomic statements
that represent program language assignments. Given an assignment,
$v\mathrel{:=}e$, the requirements of the above formal definition are
precisely met by substituting $e$ for $v$ in the ${\cal P}_i(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x})$.
Here we are tacitly assuming that program variables and expressions have
some well-defined representation as logical variables and expressions
in the logical system in use.

Procedure calls are the other common form of atomic statements and as
already discussed these can be treated much as specification statements
(with empty bodies).

If the programming language has them, then other forms of atomic statements
can be dealt with in an {\it ad hoc} way as their semantics dictates.
For example, many programming languages have a null statement form, which
corresponds to the identity operation on the set of predicates.
An atomic statement that aborted execution could be dealt with by
delivering an empty set of predicates, or equivalently, the single predicate
{\it true}, (see example pre-condition calculations at the end of this section).

Sequential composition can be handled exactly as in the formal definition:
the set of predicates calculated for the second statement is just passed
in as the target post-condition for the first statement.

If-then-else statements cause sets of predicates to be combined.
Each ${\cal P}_i(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x})$ resulting from analysing
the then-part of the conditional with condition $c$ would contribute
$c \Rightarrow {\cal P}_i(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x})$ to the result.
Similarly, each ${\cal P}_j(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x})$ resulting from
the analysis of the else-part would contribute $\neg c \Rightarrow {\cal P}_j(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x})$.

While-loops are handled by logical transformations that mimic the
various parts of the set comprehension in the formal definition above.
There are various possible approaches, some of which
necessitate a more complex representation of the post-condition
involving quantifiers, rather than a flat conjunction of quantifier-free
formulae. The Compliance Notation avoids this complexity by generating
what are called side conditions, universally closed conjectures that
have to be proved to justify the correctness of the main calculation.
From a user's perspective the end result of the whole process is just
a set of verification conditions (VCs) that have to be proved and these
side conditions just get added to the final set of VCs.
For example, in a loop with condition $c$, if the post-condition
{\it postc} in the formal definition above is represented by the
set of syntactic predicates ${\cal A}_j$, a side condition of the form
${\cal P}_i(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x}) \wedge c \Rightarrow {\cal A}_j$
is generated for each ${\cal P}_i(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x})$ in the
representation of {\it body\_postc}. This corresponds to the requirements
of the last conjunct in the set comprehension above.

Like while-loops, specification statements require a more complex
representation using quantifiers if full generality is to be achieved.
Again, the Compliance Notation adopts the simpler approach of generating
side conditions, if necessary. For example, side conditions
of the form ${\cal P}_i(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x}) \wedge c \Rightarrow {\cal A}_j$
will be generated for each ${\cal P}_i(\vec{x_0}, \vec{x})$ in the
representation of what is called
=INLINEFT
postcâ1
=TEX
\ above and for each ${\cal A}_j$ in the representation of
=INLINEFT
postc
=TEX
. This corresponds to the predicate of the set comprehension above.


We now return to the formal work.
We conjecture that the useful pre-condition calculator is sound:
πZ
‹ prec_calc_sound_cnj ?Ù prec_calc ç sound_prec_calc
∞
The following conjecture gives a useful property of our useful pre-condition
calculator, which turns out to be a simple consequence of its soundness.
πZ
‹ prec_calc_dom_cnj ?Ù
‹	µ prog: PROG; postc : P_POST_COND
‹	∑	dom (prec_calc(prog, postc) ° (id STATE)) ° dom (semantics prog)
‹			Ä dom postc
∞

We also conjecture that a program is upright in every state in the pre-condition
produced by the above pre-condition calculator, i.e., no execution of
the program can cause the pre-condition of any specification in the program
to be violated in those states.
Taken together with the soundness conjecture, this shows that a VC generator
based on the pre-condition calculator does indeed guarantee program correctness
as discussed in section~\ref{sat} above.
πZ
‹ prec_calc_upright_cnj ?Ù
‹	µ prog: PROG; postc, postc' : P_POST_COND
‹	|	postc = prec_calc(prog, postc')
‹	∑	prog %bottom% ran postc
∞

Finally, we give some evidence that the useful pre-condition
calculator really is useful by exhibiting some simple programs
for which it returns something more interesting than an empty relation.
The first block of examples covers various forms of atom.
πZ
‹ prec_calc_atom_egs_cnj ?Ù
‹	µ null, chaos, stop : PROG; postc : P_POST_COND
‹	|	null = Atom (id STATE)
‹	±	chaos = Atom (STATE ∏ STATE)
‹	±	stop = Atom ö
‹	∑	prec_calc(null, postc) = postc
‹	±	prec_calc(chaos, postc) = {s, s': STATE | postc®{s}© = STATE}
‹	±	prec_calc(stop, postc) = STATE ∏ STATE
∞
The second block gives at least one example of each of the compound
syntactic categories.
πZ
‹ prec_calc_compound_egs_cnj ?Ù
‹	µ null, chaos, stop, p, spec_null : PROG; postc : P_POST_COND; c : P_PRED
‹	|	null = Atom (id STATE)
‹	±	chaos = Atom (STATE ∏ STATE)
‹	±	stop = Atom ö
‹	±	spec_null = Spec((STATE, id STATE), null)
‹	∑	prec_calc(If(c, null, stop), postc) = postc íâ* c ¿ (STATE ∏ STATE) Åâ* c
‹	±	prec_calc(Seq(p, null), postc) = prec_calc(p, postc)
‹	±	prec_calc(Seq(null, p), postc) = prec_calc(p, postc)
‹	±	prec_calc(While(STATE, spec_null), postc) = dom postc ∏ STATE
‹	±	prec_calc (spec_null, postc) = postc
∞

There is some value in the above conjectures: it was only when I tried
to prove them that I realised that I had mistakenly written:
{\vertbarfalse
=GFT
	{s'} Ú t Ä {s} Ú postc
=TEX
instead of
=GFT
	t®{s'}© Ä postc®{s}©
=TEX
in the equation for the semantic category Atom. The pre-condition
calculator is sound and guarantees uprightness with this mistake,
but very far from useful (since the mistaken predicate will require $s' = s$ is
=INLINEFT
{s'} Ú t
=TEX
\ is not empty).
