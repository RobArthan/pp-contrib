\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document identifies various opportunites for proofs in phase II
of the Front End Filter project and comments upon their significance. 
It also contains discussion of and formal definitions relating to the
problem of finding the proofs.

\subsection{Introduction}
The specifications for phase II of the Front End Filter project are
somewhat more complicated in structure than those of phase I.
This is partly because of the greater complexity of the informal specifications
and indeed of the system they model. It is also because the separation
of security concerns from other concerns is less straightforward for the
Front End implementation than it is for the SSQL semantics.
 
The three main documents in the phase II specifications in which
the issues which are felt to be practically amenable to formal
reasoning are separated out in stages in the three
documents \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022,DS/FMU/FEF/026,DS/FMU/FEF/032}.
These are concerned with an {\em Architectural Model}, a
{\em TSQL Execution Model} and the {\em Table Computations},
respectively.

The specifications in these documents draw on supporting material
from the phase I specifications and from the documents
\cite{DS/FMU/FEF/021,DS/FMU/FEF/024,DS/FMU/FEF/025,DS/FMU/FEF/028,DS/FMU/FEF/029}
as necessary. Each of \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022,DS/FMU/FEF/026,DS/FMU/FEF/032}
identifies critical properties for the stage it is concerned with, and
each of these provides an opportunity for formal proof work.

It is the intention of the present document to give a brief overview
of the three stages of the discussion and to discuss in more detail
the strategy for carrying out partial proofs of selected critical
properties. As a result of preliminary correspondence and discussion with DRA,
it is intended to concentrate effort on the security properties which relate
most directly with the specifications of the table computations
produced by the Front End Transformations, and
so the present document goes into greater detail about this material (from
\cite{DS/FMU/FEF/032}) than it does about the other two stages.


\section{PRELIMINARIES}
The following \Product{} instructions set up the new theory $fef034$,
which is used to hold definitions relating to the properties to be proved.

\section{SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION}
The present document provides a convenient point to pull together
the constructions of the other phase II specification to give the
formal definition of the behavioural model of the SWORD system
whose security properties we wish to investigate by formal proof:

πHOLCONST
‹	FE_SWORD_SYSTEM : (Query, ANSWER) BEHAVIOURS
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹	FE_SWORD_SYSTEM = FE_SWORD reprState TSQLtf STP outputFilter
∞

Thus the model is obtained by applying the architectural
construction function $FE\_SWORD$ of \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022} to the
components of \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022,DS/FMU/FEF/025,DS/FMU/FEF/021,DS/FMU/FEF/024}.

The overall security conjecture we are interested in is the assertion
that this behavioural model satisfies the security policy defined
in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/003}. This may be captured in the following definition:

πHOLCONST
‹	FE_SWORD_SYSTEM_secure : BOOL
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹	FE_SWORD_SYSTEM_secure § FE_SWORD_SYSTEM ç secure
∞

\section{ARCHITECTURAL MODEL}\label{ARCHITECTURALMODEL}

A formal model of the architecture of the Front End Implementation
of SWORD is given in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022}. This architectural model
defines how certain subsystems with specified interfaces are combined
to produce a behavioural model of the SWORD system to which the formal
security policy of \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/003} applies directly.
\cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022} also defines critical properties on the subsystem
and states a conjecture that the policy is satisfied if these hold.

The subsystems identified in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022} are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The target DBMS, thought of as a processor of TSQL queries.
\item
An Output Filter, informally specified in \cite{filter},
whose main role is to purge data from the output of
the target DBMS which the client is not cleared to see.
\item
The SSQL Transformation Processor, informally specified in cite{trans},
whose main role is to map SSQL queries into
sequences of one or two TSQL queries to
be executed on the target DBMS.
\end{itemize}

The main functional aspect described in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022} is the
overall interconnection of these three subsystems. In particular, it
defines the way the optional check queries produced by the
SSQL Transformation Processor are used to prevent execution of queries
which would otherwise cause illegal information flows which the Output
Filter is not able to suppress.

\cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022} identifies five critical properties. Four of
these, $subsys\_secureA \ldots subsys\_secureD$ constrain only
the SSQL transformation processor and the target DBMS. The fifth
$subsys\_secureE$ constrains all three subsystems. What is, in effect,
the conjunction of the five properties is given the name
$subsys\_secure$; it is conjectured that, if the three subsystems
have this combined property, then the SWORD system constructed from them
by the architectural model will satisfy the the security policy.

The architectural security conjecture taken from the
informal discussion at the end of \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022} may be recorded
for future reference in a metalanguage variable\footnote{%
Because this conjecture is polymorphic, i.e. containx type variables,
ProofPower does not allow us to define a boolean constants
to capture it in the theory database (essentially because the truth
value might depend on the instantiation of the type variables in the
conjecture, which would render the definition inconsistent). Consequently,
we use terms held in metalanguage variables to record such conjectures rather
than follow the style of \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/007}.
}%

	µrepr dbms stp filter∑
			(dbms, stp, filter) ç subsys_secure repr
		¥	FE_SWORD repr dbms stp filter ç secure
Æ;
=TEX

It is expected that the proof of this lemma would be quite similar to
that of the unwinding result proved during phase I for the SSQL
semantics (see \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/007}). Indeed, it is likely that the
commonality between the two could be exploited to adapt parts of the
phase I proofs for re-use here.  These common parts would be those
concerned with showing that appropriate critical properties on the
transition function of the system entail the security of the
behavioural model constructed from it. The more novel part of the proof
would mainly be concerned with the function $mkTf\sb{f}$ of
\cite{DS/FMU/FEF/022} which constructs the transition functions on the
system and is largely concerned with looking after the optional check
query and the check it makes.

The particular instance of this conjecture with which we are concerned
is captured by the following definition.

πHOLCONST
‹	Phase2_Lemma1 : BOOL
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹	Phase2_Lemma1 §
‹		(TSQLtf, STP, outputFilter) ç subsys_secure reprState
‹		¥
‹		FE_SWORD_SYSTEM ç secure
‹		
∞

On the basis of the definition of $subsys\_secure$ the hypothesis
here might be expected to reduce to 5 subsidiary lemmas as
follows:

πHOLCONST
‹	Phase2_Lemma1A : BOOL;
‹	Phase2_Lemma1B : BOOL;
‹	Phase2_Lemma1C : BOOL;
‹	Phase2_Lemma1D : BOOL;
‹	Phase2_Lemma1E : BOOL
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹	(Phase2_Lemma1A § (TSQLtf, STP) ç subsys_secureA reprState) ±
‹	(Phase2_Lemma1B § (TSQLtf, STP) ç subsys_secureB reprState) ±
‹	(Phase2_Lemma1C § (TSQLtf, STP) ç subsys_secureC reprState) ±
‹	(Phase2_Lemma1D § (TSQLtf, STP) ç subsys_secureD reprState) ±
‹	(Phase2_Lemma1E § (TSQLtf, STP, outputFilter) ç subsys_secureE reprState)
∞

Of these 5 only part E is concerned with the $SELECT$ query. It is this
part which the rest of the proof work will concentrate on.

\section{EXECUTION MODEL}\label{EXECUTIONMODEL}
The formal definition of the Output Filter, the SSQL Transformation Processor
and the TSQL semantics for SWORD is given in the documents
\cite{DS/FMU/FEF/028,DS/FMU/FEF/029,DS/FMU/FEF/024,DS/FMU/FEF/021}.
This material is related to the architectural model by the execution
model defined in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/026}. This execution model serves both
to bring the pieces together and to relate the specification of the
transformations to a conceptually simpler semantic description of how
SSQL queries are intended to be executed on the target database.
