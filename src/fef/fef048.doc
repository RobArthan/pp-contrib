\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope} \label{scope}

This document is a report on the proof work carried out under phase 3 of the FEF project.
It constitutes deliverable D18 as described in the phase 3 proposal, \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/039}.

\subsection{Introduction}

The background to the phase 3 technical work is discussed in the proposal,  \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/039}.
The specifications produced in phase 3 are overviewed in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/039}.
This document simply serves to identify the main theorems which were proved and give a pointer to the location of the proofs in the documentation structure.

\section{DESCRIPTION OF THE PROOFS}


The main objective behind the proof work in phase 3 was to debug the the phase 3 specifications.
The proof work therefore mainly comprises consistency proofs, and proofs of various conjectures which are identified in some of the specification documents as being useful or significant.

The proofs relate to three specification documents:
{\em Multi-level Formal Security Policy} \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/040};
{\em Multi-level Architectural Model}  \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/042};
and {\em The Labelling Property for SWORD} \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/043}.
Because of the relatively small size of the proofs in phase 3, the proof scripts relating to the three documents are collected together into a single document, {\em Proof About Labelling} \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/044}, which devotes a section to each of the three specification documents.
The document \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/045} contains listings of the theories containing both the specifications and the theorems proved, together with a listing of the theory {\em wrk057} which contains some supporting material borrowed from a {\Product} example document.
The remaining sections of this document

\subsection{Supporting Material}

The {\Product} example document \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK057} is used to support the phase 3 specifications.
It creates a theory, {\em wkr057} dealing with trees with arbitrary finite branching which are used to represent the tree-structured objects which model SSQL queries and their results.
The theorems of \cite{DS/FMU/IED/WRK057} are all of a purely mathematical and somewhat technical nature.
From the point of view of the FEF work, the main role of the document is to characterise a polymorphic type, $'a\,TREE$, comprising trees with arbitrary finite branching and with nodes labelled with elements of the parameter type, $'a$.
This type is characterised by its constructor function, $MkTree$, which constructs a tree given the label and immediate subtrees of its root node.
The mathematical properties of $MkTree$ are characterised by the theorems
=INLINEFT
tree_prim_rec_thm
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
tree_induction_thm
=TEX
.
A deep understanding of these theorems should not be necessary for an understanding of the theorems relating to the phase 3 specifications proper.

\subsection{Multi-level Security Policy}
The proof scripts in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/044} populate the theory {\em fef040} with various theorems about the generic security policy and the material on component extraction in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/040}.
The two main theorems are
=INLINEFT
thm_040_1
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
thm_040_2
=TEX
\ which confirm the conjectures
=INLINEFT
conj_040_1
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
conj_040_2
=TEX
\ identified and discused in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/040}.
The theory {\em fef040} also contains a number of general lemmas about the generic security policy and some specific lemmas required for the main theorems.

\subsection{Multi-level Architectural Model}


The proof scripts in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/044} populate the theory {\em fef042} with various theorems about the architectural model of \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/042}.
The main conjectures identified in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/042} have not yet been formally proved, but it is not considered to be a difficult task to complete the proofs.
\subsection{Labelling Property}
The proof scripts in \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/044} populate the theory {\em fef042} with a few lemmas about the labelling property of \cite{DS/FMU/FEF/042}.
The main goal is a consistency proof for the result labelling property.
This has not yet been achieved, but is not considered to be a major task.
