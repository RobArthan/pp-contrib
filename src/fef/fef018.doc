\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document provides a revised proposal  for Phase~2 of the DRA front end filter project RSRE 1C/6130.

\subsection{Introduction} \label{INTRO}

In the original proposal for this project, \cite{DS/FMU/017}, it was stated that a firm price costed proposal for the supply of items 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the ITT schedule, found in \cite{ittdra}, would be provided at the end of Phase~1.


Some problems arise in making a quotation for the Phase 2 work:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The specifications for the system about which proofs will be conducted are still substantially incomplete.
It is apparent that these specifications when complete will be significantly more complex than those supplied with the original invitation to tender for this contract.
This particularly concerns the specifications for the filter, but the specifications for the SSQL database have also been modified since the Phase 1 proof work was started and have not yet been reformalised.
\item
It appears likely, judging by the information currently available, that the full correctness and security proof for the database as implemented using the filter would be prohibitively costly.
\end{itemize}

The contract for Phase 1 was based on the premise that the specifications were well formed and secure, and called for a security proof.
A significant number of errors were discovered in the specifications, and the extra costs arising had to be dealt with by amendments to the contract.
We are therefore costing Phase 2 on the assumption that ICL will be given a larger amount of discretion in the formalisation of the models, and in the resolution of problems discovered in these models.
This should substantially reduce the probability of contract amendments being required during Phase 2.

As a result of the experience in Phase 1 it would seem more appropriate to regard the objectives as:
\begin{itemize}
\item To use the proof process to discover flaws in the specifications.
\item To evolve the specification during the course of the proof as necessary to render it satisfactory.
\end{itemize}

The main purpose of the requirement for Phase 2 in the original ITT was to verify the design of the Front End Filter.
The most important (if not the only) concern was that the filter would result in a secure database.

This proposal for Phase 2 therefore attempts to provide the most effective way of employing formal modelling and proof to improve confidence in the security of the Front End Filter.

=IGN
However, DRA have made substantial changes to the specifications of the SSQL query transformations on which our quotation for Phase~2 was to be based.
These specifications are now much more complex than those in the ITT from DRA, and yet remain incomplete. In addition, significant changes
 have been made by DRA to the abstract syntax of SSQL
from that which was formalised by ICL in Phase~1 of 
this contract. DRA do not, however, propose to revise
their informal specifications of the semantics of
SSQL to accommodate these changes in the abstract syntax.

We have therefore  amended items 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the ITT schedule 
where we deem it necessary in the light of the 
difficulties described above, and provide below, in section \ref{PROPOSAL}, a revised proposal
for the work to be carried out in Phase~2. 
In section \ref{QUOTATION} we provide a fixed price
 quotation for the first part of the proposed Phase~2, 
which essentially takes the specification work to the point at which a quotation for the proposed proof work is feasible, together with a budgetary estimate for the 
 remainder of Phase~2, comprising mainly that proof work.
We envisage that the first part of Phase~2 will take
about five months and the second part about ten months.
The cost of these two parts will be approximately the same,
 with more effort and more senior resources employed
in the first part of Phase~2, the critical part of the
project where we analyse the specifications and formalise
the proposition to be proven.

\section{PROPOSAL FOR PHASE 2} \label{PROPOSAL}

The work proposed for Phase~2 is based on items 3 and 4 of the ITT schedule of requirements in \cite{ittdra}. In discussion with DRA-ED  it has been decided to delete items 5 and 
6 from the schedule of requirements. In addition, it was 
agreed to formalise the SSQL query
 transformations in standard ML. The purpose of this 
formalisation is to increase confidence in the correctness 
of the query transformations and to facilitate 
the maintenance of the specifications by  DRA-ED. Because of the present state of the relevant specifications considerably more work is involved in the formalisation of the propositions to be proven than originally envisaged, and the cost of any proof work is more difficult to establish.


\subsection{Item Number 3 - Formalisation and Proof}

We propose initially to formalise the SSQL query
 transformations in standard ML. The next step in Phase~2 is the formalisation of the models of the relevant systems and of the propositions to be proven.
This may involve re-structuring the specifications in 
a way which focuses on the security aspects.
 The propositions offered for proof  will be chosen to yield best assurance of security of the filter within the proposed cost limits for Phase 2.

The remainder of item 3  consists in developing the formal proof of the selected propositions.
It is proposed, by contrast with the arrangements for Phase 1, that when errors in the models or in the propositions are discovered, ICL will have discretion, in consultation with DRA, to make appropriate modifications to the specifications and to the propositions, so as to yield best results from the remaining work within the original cost profile.

Item 3 is described in greater detail as follows:

\begin{description}

\item[Initial Formalisation of the SSQL  query transformations]\ 

The informal specifications of the SSQL query transformations
 will be formalised in standard ML. This will necessitate
 the formalisation of the datatypes of SSQL and TSQL in standard ML.

\item[Formalisation of the TSQL abstract machine]\ 

The supplied abstract syntax of TSQL (known as standard SQL in \cite{ittdra}) is intended to be based on the semantics of SSQL.
DRA have supplied a revised abstract syntax of SSQL which differs from that on which the Phase~1 formalisation of the semantics of SSQL was based.
Formal modelling of the TSQL database undertaken during Phase 2 will focus on those aspects of the underlying database which are essential to the security of the database resulting from the addition of the filter, and may omit any details not essential to the proposed proof work.

\item[Formalisation of the SSQL query transformations]\ 

We propose to re-structure the query transformations so as to minimise the costs of the subsequent formal proofs (which should have a beneficial effect on their intelligibility).
Details which are immaterial to the security proofs may be omitted, and features of the models which are particularly problematic from the point of view of the security proof may be omitted or simplified.
All such points will be clearly documented in the accompanying informal text.  

\item[Formalisation of SSQL implementation behavioural model]\ 

A mathematical model will be constructed of the behaviour of the SSQL system as implemented using the TSQL abstract machine and the specified filters.
This should be a routine construction. 

=IGN
\item[Formalisation of the critical properties of TSQL]\
 
The critical properties of TSQL, i.e. those properties on which the security of the SSQL database depend, are identified and formalised.
=TEX

\item[Formalisation of security propositions]\ 

It is our present view that a full functional correctness proof for the SSQL database as implemented using the filter is not feasible within cost limits acceptable to DRA.
It is therefore proposed to focus the proof effort in Phase 2 on the security of the SSQL database.
The state of the specifications at this time does not allow a reliable estimate of the cost of a full security proof for the SSQL database.

It is proposed that on completion of the specification work, ICL will identify the proposition or propositions, relating to the security of the filter implementation of the SSQL 
database, the proof of which will most effectively improve assurance of security within the proposed cost limits for  Phase 2.
DRA will be consulted during this process to facilitate agreement on the propositions to be proven.

=IGN
In the original proposal, a strategy was outlined for proving the correctness of the SSQL behavioural model. 
Essentially this was to prove the proposition that the behavioural models of the SSQL implementation and the SSQL abstract machine are identical.
Having established the correctness of the SSQL implementation, the proof of security of the SSQL implementation follows `for free' from the Phase~1 proof of security of the SSQL abstract machine.
We are now in the position of being unable to prove the correctness of the SSQL implementation since the semantics of the SSQL abstract machine have
been changed by DRA. We will formalise the security proposition
for the behavioural model of the SSQL implementation
directly from the formalisations described above. This will be of the form that if the
TSQL abstract machine satisfies its critical properties
then the behaviour of the SSQL implementation  will be secure.
=TEX
\item[Proofs]\

Machine checked formal proofs of the agreed security propositions identified above will be developed and delivered to DRA.

In the event of any of these propositions proving to be false or intractible ICL will consult with DRA with a view to identifying corrective actions which maximise benefits within the proposed cost limits.
