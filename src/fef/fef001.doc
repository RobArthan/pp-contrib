\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document identifies the quality procedures to be adhered to
 in the DRA front end filter project RSRE 1C/6130.
This document also defines the configuration management
practices to be followed for the DRA front end filter project RSRE 1C/6130.
This is intended to cover all documentation and formal
texts.

\subsection{Introduction}
This document acts as an overview to the DRA front end filter project.
It describes the directory structure for the project filestore and
gives a list of the documents
in the project together with brief abstracts of their contents.
The quality control mechanisms for the project are
defined in the 	suite of documents referred to in 
the ICL Technology Projects Quality Guide, \cite{tp.qwg.001}.
All the documents produced for this project to be delivered to the customer
 will conform
to the standards defined in the Technology Projects Documentation Standards,
\cite{tp.qwg.002}, except that the final report
may be in a format requested by the customer. The approval authority for
deliverables to DRA is Roger Jones, the manager of the High
Assurance Team (HAT).
The main background document to the project is the original proposal, \cite{DS/FMU/017}.
Amendments to the proposal may be found in \cite{amend1} and \cite{amend2}.
=IGN
In section \ref{PROJ} there is a list of the project codes to be used for this project.
=TEX

The final section, \ref{BACK},  describes the procedure
for backing up the $fef$ username.
\subsection{Terminology}
\begin{description}
\item [literate script]
This is a file which contains both formal
material (a program or a specification, say) and
narrative text. The formal material can be automatically
extracted for processing (e.g. by a compiler). The file
can be typeset (using \LaTeX) to give a document standard
listing of the formal material and the narrative.
The formal material is held in the document in such a
way that it can also be extracted fairly easily when
using an interactive compiler or similar program.
\end{description}
\section{PROOF POWER}
Reference is made throughout this document to the \Product{} system. 
This is the chosen theorem proving tool for this project, referred to in the original proposal, \cite{DS/FMU/017}, as ICL HOL. The facilities 
available in \Product{} are documented in  \cite{DS/FMU/IED/USR006} 

\section{CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT AND CHANGE CONTROL}
\subsection{Hardware and Operating System}
The project is being carried out on 
 Sun  workstations networked via the Winnersh site LAN.
The systems 
run Sun Microsystems' variant (SUNOS) of the UNIX operating
system. The project is currently working with version
4.1.1 of this operating system.

For the purposes of this document the UNIX operating
system will be taken to include the programs  and the programming interfaces
described in \cite{sunOS4.1manuals}.
\subsection{Source Code Control System SCCS}
The UNIX configuration control system {\tt sccs} will
be the basic configuration control mechanism for the
project. This document assumes
familiarity with {\tt sccs} (see \cite{sunOS4.1manuals})
and with the UNIX build control system {\tt make}.
All source files in the project library will be held
under {\tt sccs} control.  They will be literate scripts prepared using \LaTeX\
supplemented by the features available in the \Product{} system for printing
documents containing Z and HOL. All theories under the \Product{} system will be generated
by such documents automatically using the facilities provided
in the \Product{} system and the UNIX {\tt make} facility.
Documents should always contain an index of defining occurrences
of formal names occurring in them, which
should be the last section of the document. The penultimate section
of all documents which create theories will usually be a listing of the theory.
\section{DIRECTORY STRUCTURE} \label{DIRECTORYSTRUCTURE}
The definitive versions of all material prepared in the
project on the SUN network is held in directories
owned by the user \verb"fef". 
The master form for all  documentation is held
under {\tt sccs} control in the filestore of the HAT SUN network
in directories owned by the user {\tt fef}.
The directory structure of this user's home directory
is described in table \ref{DirectoryStructure}.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{||l|p{5.0in}||} \hline
Name & Description \\ \hline \hline
\verb"~fef/SCCS" & {\tt sccs} database directory for project
documentation and related files.\\ \hline
\verb"~fef/docs" &  Used for preparation of
documents other than literate scripts.\\ \hline
%\verb"~fef/approved" & This directory will contain a master makefile
%(which will also be in {\tt sccs}). The makefile
%will be used to maintain in this directory the entire approved theory structure f%or the front
%end filter. The makefile will
%retrieve specifically from {\tt sccs} the latest authorised
%versions of the front
%end filter documents. \\ \hline
\verb"~fef/build" & This directory will
be used for building  working versions of the theory structure.
This directory will contain its own makefile, which
may use more recent versions of documents
than those in the `approved' directory. \\ \hline
\verb"~fef/tex" & Holds \TeX-ware which is specific
to the project (e.g. the bibliography database
\verb"fef.bib"). \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Project Directory Structure} \label{DirectoryStructure}
\end{table}

The home directory will also contain directories for holding general \TeX-ware
and \Product{} software.

\section{DOCUMENT SUMMARIES}
This section gives a summary of the content of each document
produced in the DRA front end filter project. Document references are of the
form `DS/FMU/FEF/nnn', where nnn is a three digit 
number. All documents are held under {\tt sccs} control in the directory
\verb"~fef/SCCS". The name of the {\tt sccs} file is derived from the document
reference, e.g. ``DS/FMU/FEF/999'' would be held in
\verb"~fef/SCCS/s.fef999.doc".

\section{DOCUMENT PREPARATION}
All the documents for this project, apart perhaps for the
final report,  will conform
to the standards defined in TP.QWG.002.  When a document has passed all
inspections prior to internal approval it will then be printed
with its correct issue number. Authorised issues
will normally have issue numbers of the form `n.1'.

All documents containing formal text will be printed with an index
which will contain as a minimum the defining occurrences of all the formally defined names.

All documents which create a theory will usually contain a listing of the 
theory.
=IGN
This will be done by including the file name "thname.thp"
(without absolute path, relative to current directory), where "thname" is the name of the theory.
The makefile in  the approved directory will arrange for the theory to be listed to this file before printing
the document.

Final copies printed for approval will be printed from directory `approved'
to ensure that the theory listing in the document corresponds to
theory contents when built
exclusively using approved versions of other theories.
