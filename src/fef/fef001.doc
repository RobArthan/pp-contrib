\section{GENERAL}
\subsection{Scope}
This document defines the configuration management
practices to be followed for the DRA front end filter project RSRE 1C/6130.
This is intended to cover all documentation and formal
texts.

\subsection{Introduction}
This document acts as an overview to the DRA front end filter project.
It describes the directory structure for the project filestore and
gives a list of the documents
in the project together with brief abstracts of their contents.
The quality control mechanisms for the project are
defined in the 	suite of documents referred to in 
the ICL Technology Projects Quality Guide, \cite{tp.qwg.001}.
All the documents produced for this project will conform
to the standards defined in the Technology Projects Documentation Standards,
\cite{tp.qwg.002}, except that the final report
may be in a format requested by the customer.
The main background document to the project is the original proposal, \cite{DS/FMU/017}.

In section \ref{PROJ} there is a list of the project codes to be used for this project.

The final section, \ref{BACK},  describes the procedure
for backing up the $fef$ username.
\subsection{Terminology}
\begin{description}
\item [literate script]
This is a file which contains both formal
material (a program or a specification, say) and
narrative text. The formal material can be automatically
extracted for processing (e.g. by a compiler). The file
can be typeset (using \LaTeX) to give a document standard
listing of the formal material and the narrative.
The formal material is held in the document in such a
way that it can also be extracted fairly easily when
using an interactive compiler or similar program.
\end{description}
\section{ICL HOL}
Reference is made throughout this document to the ICL HOL system. 
This is the chosen theorem proving tool for this project, as
stated in the original proposal , \cite{DS/FMU/017}. The facilities 
available in ICL HOL are documented in  \cite{DS/FMU/IED/???} 

\section{CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT AND CHANGE CONTROL}
\subsection{Hardware and Operating System}
The project is being carried out on 
 Sun  workstations networked via the Winnersh site LAN.
The systems 
run Sun Microsystems' variant (SUNOS) of the UNIX operating
system. The project is currently working with version
4.1.1 of this operating system.

For the purposes of this document the UNIX operating
system will be taken to include the programs described
in \cite{Sun86a} and the programming interfaces
described in \cite{Sun86b}.
\subsection{Source Code Control System SCCS}
The UNIX configuration control system {\tt sccs} will
be the basic configuration control mechanism for the
project. This document assumes
familiarity with {\tt sccs} (see \cite{Sun86a})
and with the UNIX build control system {\tt make}.
All source files in the project library will be held
under {\tt sccs} control.  They will be literate scripts prepared using \LaTeX\
supplemented by the features available in the ICL HOL system for printing
documents containing Z and HOL. All theories under the ICL HOL system will be generated
by such documents automatically using the facilities provided
in the ICL HOL system and the UNIX {\tt make} facility.
Documents should always contain an index of defining occurrences
of formal names occurring in them, which
should be the last section of the document. The penultimate section
of all documents which create theories will be a listing of the theory.
\section{DIRECTORY STRUCTURE} \label{DIRECTORYSTRUCTURE}
The definitive versions of all material prepared in the
project on the SUN network is held in directories
owned by the user \verb"fef". 
The master form for all  documentation is held
under {\tt sccs} control in the filestore of the HAT SUN network
in directories owned by the user {\tt fef}.
The directory structure of this user's home directory
is described in table \ref{DirectoryStructure}.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{||l|p{5.0in}||} \hline
Name & Description \\ \hline \hline
\verb"~fef/SCCS" & {\tt sccs} database directory for project
documentation and related files.\\ \hline
\verb"~fef/docs" &  Used for preparation of
documents other than literate scripts.\\ \hline
\verb"~fef/approved" & This directory will contain a master makefile
(which will also be in {\tt sccs}). The makefile
will be used to maintain in this directory the entire approved theory structure for the front
end filter. The makefile will
retrieve specifically from {\tt sccs} the latest authorised
versions of the front
end filter documents. \\ \hline
\verb"~fef/build" & This directory will
be used for building  unapproved working versions of the theory structure.
This directory will contain its own makefile, which
will use more recent versions of documents
than those in the `approved' directory. \\ \hline
\verb"~fef/tex" & Holds \TeX-ware which is specific
to the project (e.g. the bibliography database
\verb"fef.bib"). \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Project Directory Structure} \label{DirectoryStructure}
\end{table}
\section{DOCUMENT SUMMARIES}
This section gives a summary of the content of each document
produced in the DRA front end filter project. Document references are of the
form `DS/FMU/FEF/nnn', where nnn is a three digit 
number. All documents are held under {\tt sccs} control in the directory
\verb"~fef/SCCS". The name of the {\tt sccs} file is derived from the document
reference, e.g. ``DS/FMU/FEF/999'' would be held in
\verb"~fef/SCCS/s.fef999.doc".
\subsection{001 Project Overview Document}
This document [DS/FMU/FEF/001]
\subsection{002 Errors in the SSQL Specification}

of the ITT [DS/FMU/FEF/002]
\subsection{003 Formal Security Policy}
 The formalisation of the security conjecture is in this document [DS/FMU/FEF/003]
\subsection{004 Specifications of $hide$ and $updateState$}
The formal specifications of the functions $hide$ and $updateState$.
\subsection{005 Specification of SSQL Semantics}

\end{table}



\section{DOCUMENT PREPARATION}
All the documents for this project, apart perhaps for the
final report,  will conform
to the standards defined in TP.QWG.002.  When a document has passed all
inspections prior to internal approval it will then be printed
with its correct issue number. Authorised issues
will normally have issue numbers of the form `n.1'.

All documents containing formal text will be printed with an index
which will contain as a minimum the defining occurrences of all the formally defined names.

All documents which create a theory will contain an automatically generated listing of the theory.
=IGN
This will be done by including the file name "thname.thp"
(without absolute path, relative to current directory), where "thname" is the name of the theory.
The makefile in  the approved directory will arrange for the theory to be listed to this file before printing
the document.

Final copies printed for approval will be printed from directory `approved'
to ensure that the theory listing in the document corresponds to
theory contents when built
exclusively using approved versions of other theories.

\section{SCHEDULE FOR BACKING UP THE $fef$ USERNAME} \label{BACK}
The entire filestore under the username $fef$ will be saved at the end of each day that work has
been carried out in $fef$.  The tapes are to be stored
within their supplied case, and are kept in the cupboard in GS46. The tapes are to be given a unique reference number
of the form ASD/HAT/FEF/xxx where `xxx' denotes the 
day of the week.
