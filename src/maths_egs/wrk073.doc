\section{THE THEORY {\em fincomb}}\label{theory}

\subsection{Preliminaries}
The following commands set up a theory to hold the definitions, theorems, etc.,  and a proof context that is convenient for the work.
The theory is a child of the theory ``analysis'' (defined in~\cite{LEMMA1/HOL/WRK066}) from which we use several definitions, in particular, the characteristic function $\chi_A$ of a set $A$.

\subsection{Folding Binary Operators over Finite Sets}

The following definition of a ``fold'' operation for finite sets is parametrised by three things: an associative and commutative binary operator, $p$, with identity element, $e$, and a ``valuation'' function $v$; the operation maps the valuation function over a set combining the resulting values with the product operation.

‹ ±	µx a∑	a ç Finite ± ≥x ç a
‹	¥	SetFold e p v ({x} ¿ a) = p (v x) (SetFold e p v a)
∞
The parametrisation of {\em SetFold} is as recommended by Nipkow and Paulson and works nicely. An alternative would be to combine $p$ and $v$ into a single function, say $f = \lambda x y \bullet p(v x) y$
but then the algebraic laws that $f$ must satisfy have an unfamiliar form. The two approaches are interdefinable.

The theorems in the theory begin by with some lemmas about finite sets and their sizes.
These are then used to prove two lemmas needed to prove the consistency of the definition of {\em SetFold}.

\subsection{Further Theorems About Finiteness}
The first block of theorems extends the repertoire of lemmas about finite sets and their sizes.
The approach to this topic in the {\ProductHOL} library tends to characterise a finite set, $A$, as one that can be written as $\Elems{L}$ for some list $L$ and the size $\Size{A}$ as the length $\Size{L}$ where $L$ is a list of distinct elements with $\Elems{L} = A$.

The first few theorems are aimed at an alternative characterisation of a finite set $A$ as one that is in one-one correspondence with an initial subset of the natural numbers, $\{i | i < m\}$ for some $m$.
{\em En route} are proved various useful facts, e.g., that finiteness and size are preserved under bijections.

The next block of theorems deal with the power set operator.
$\Zpset\,a$
 is defined in the {\ProductHOL} library by the bi-implication
$x \in \Zpset a \iff x \subseteq a$.
The first theorem below just recasts this as an equation.
There are then two trivial but quite useful lemmas about binary partitions of a power set.
This is followed by the theorem that, if $a$ is finite, then so is $\Zpset a$ and $\Size{\Zpset a} = 2^{\Size{a}}$

\subsection{Sums over Finite Indexed Sets}
A useful application of the set fold operation is to define the following indexed sum operation. Given an index set, $a$, and a function, $f$, assigning a real number to each member of $a$,
=INLINEFT
IndSum a f
=TEX
\ is the indexed sum $\sum_{x\in a}f(x)$, and is defined for any set $a$ in which $f$ has finite support.


πHOLCONST
‹ €IndSum› : 'a SET ≠ ('a ≠ Ø) ≠ Ø
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ µf∑	IndSum {} f = ÓØ 0
‹ ±	µx a∑	a ç Finite ± ≥x ç a
‹	¥	IndSum ({x} ¿ a) f = f x + IndSum a f
∞

We will write $\sum\,a\,f$ as shorthand for
=INLINEFT
IndSum a f
=TEX
.
=SML
declare_alias("ì", ¨IndSumÆ);
=TEX

The consistency proof for {\em IndSum} is very simple given the set fold operation.
As with {\em SetFold}, the definition is intended to cover the two important cases where $a$ is finite ({\em ind\_sum\_def1}) or where $f$ has finite support ({\em ind\_sum\_def2}).

\ThmsII{%
=GFT
IndSum_consistent
=TEX
}{%
=GFT
ind_sum_def
=TEX
}

We now begin to develop the theory of indexed sums.
The first result is an example: if $A$ is finite,
then its size $\Size{A}$ may be calculated as the indexed sum $\sum_A\,1$.
The next few theorems show that the indexed sum operator $\sum_A\,f$ is linear in $f$ (i.e., it respects addition and multiplication by a constant) and give some useful consequences of this.

A principle that is applied almost unconsciously in informal reasoning is that the indexed sum $\sum_A f$ is a local property of $f$, in the sense that, if $f$ and $g$ are functions that agree on $A$, then $\sum_A f = \sum_A g$.
This block  of theorems concludes with one showing how indexed sums behave when the function is composed with a bijection: if $b$ is a bijection on the set $A$ and $B$ is the image of $A$ under $b$, then $\sum_B f = \sum_A (\lambda x\bullet f(b(x)))$

\ThmsIII{%

ind_sum_diff_0_thm
=TEX
}{%
=GFT
ind_sum_local_thm
ind_sum_0_bc_thm
bijection_ind_sum_thm
=TEX
}

We now have two lemmas for calculating the indexed sum in two cases where there is at most one non-zero value in the sum:

\ThmsII{
=GFT
ind_sum_—_singleton_thm
=TEX
}{%
=GFT
ind_sum_singleton_thm
=TEX
}

Next comes an induction principle for functions of finite support, i.e., functions $f$ such that $f(x) \not= 0$ for at most finitely many $x$.
If $p$ is any property of functions that is true for the characteristic function, $\chi_{\{x\}}$, of any singleton set, $\{x\}$, and that is preserved under addition and multiplication by a constant (for operands of finite support), then $p(f)$ holds for any function $f$ of finite support.

In working with an indexed sum $\sum_A f$, one can always assume that $f$ has finite support (by adjusting it to be 0 outside $A$ if necessary). This induction principle gives a different line of attack on $\sum_A f$, which can be particularly useful if the internal structure of $A$ is complex.

\ThmsII{
=GFT
fin_supp_induction_thm
=TEX
}{}

We will use the induction principle for functions of finite support to tackle the inclusion/exclusion principle.
The inclusion/exclusion principle deals with a family $U_i$ of sets where $i$ range over a finite and non-empty index set $I$.
The inclusion/exclusion principle is the following equation giving the size of the union of the $U_i$.
\begin{equation}
\Size{\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i} =
\sum_%
	{\begin{array}{c}J \in \Zpset I\\ J \not= \{\}\end{array}}%
		(-1)^{\Size{J} + 1}%
	\Size{\bigcap_{j \in J}U_j}
\end{equation}

This is a special case of a more general statement about indexed sums and the more general statement is actually rather simpler to prove.
The more general statement is the following, which holds for $U_i$ and $I$ above and any real-valued function $f$:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{x \in \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i} f(x)=
\sum_%
	{\begin{array}{c}J \in \Zpset I\\ J \not= \{\}\end{array}}%
		(-1)^{\Size{J} + 1}%
	\left(\sum_%
		{z \in \bigcap_{j \in J}U_j}%
			f(z)%
	\right)
\end{equation}

The statement about sizes follows immediately from the statement about indexed sums by applying it to the function $f(x) = 1$.
The statement about sums is better understood in the following more symmetric form in which $A = \bigcup_{i \in I}U_i$ is the range of the sum on the left-hand side of the above equation:
\begin{equation}
\sum_%
	{J \in \Zpset I}%
		(-1)^{\Size{J}}%
	\left(\sum_%
		{z \in A \cap \bigcap_{j \in J}U_j}%
			f(z)%
	\right) %
	= 0 \label{sym_inc_exc}
\end{equation}

Here, the intersections with $A$ in the range of the inner sum have no effect except when $J$ is empty.
The previous statement thus follows from the above simply by subtracting the sum over the non-empty $J$ from both sides of the equation.

It is quite natural to attempt to prove equation (\ref{sym_inc_exc}) by induction on $I$ (or on the size of $I$). This works, but the proof is somewhat complicated. Somewhat simpler is to work by induction on $A$, but it it still quite complex.
Instead, our proof of the inclusion/exclusion principle implements the above remarks together with the proof of equation (\ref{sym_inc_exc}) sketched below which works by induction on the structure of $f$.



Changing it to be identically 0 outside A if necessary, we may assume $f$ has finite support, and, as the left-hand side of (\ref{sym_inc_exc}) is easily seen to be linear in $f$, the principle of induction for functions of finite support means it is sufficient to prove (\ref{sym_inc_exc}) when $f = \chi_{\{x\}}$ is the characteristic function of a singleton set $\{x\}$.
For $f = \chi_{\{x\}}$, the summand $f(z)$ on the left-hand side of (\ref{sym_inc_exc}) is 1 or 0 according as $z = x$ or not.
Thus the inner sum is 1 if $x \in U_j$ for all $j \in J$ and vanishes otherwise.

So, if $x$ is not in any $U_j$, the left-hand side of (\ref{sym_inc_exc}) vanishes and we are done, and, if $x$ is in some $U_j$, (\ref{sym_inc_exc}) reduces to:
\begin{equation}
\sum_%
	{J \in \Zpset \{j \in I | x \in U_j\}}%
		(-1)^{\Size{J}}%
	= 0 \label{ind_sum_p}
\end{equation}

(Formally, we are appealing here to the special case of the inclusion/exclusion principle when $\Size{I}=2$, which states that $\sum_{B \cup C}f = \sum_B f + \sum_C f - \sum_{B \cap C}f$, with $B = \Zpset \{j \in I | x \in U_j\}$ and $C = \Zpset I \backslash B$.)

But now I claim that 
$
\sum_%
	{J \in \Zpset K}%
		(-1)^{\Size{J}}%
	= 0
$ for any non-empty indexed set $K$, which, taking $K=\{j \in I | x \in U_j\}$ in (\ref{ind_sum_p}) will complete the proof.

To see that $
\sum_%
	{J \in \Zpset K}%
		(-1)^{\Size{J}}%
	= 0
$ for any non-empty indexed set $K$, pick $k \in K$, then, as $J$ ranges over $\Zpset(K \backslash \{k\})$, the sets $J$ and $J \cup \{i\}$ range over $\Zpset K$ (with every member of $\Zpset K$ appearing exactly once).
As $(-1)^{\Size{J}} = -(-1)^{\Size{J \cup \{i\}}}$, the contributions of $J$ and $J \cup \{i\}$ cancel out and the sum is zero. (Formally, we are again using the special case of the principle for $\Size{I} = 2$ together with the result about indexed sums composed with a bijection.)

The above proof is captured in the following series of theorems, which give the main steps in the above argument in bottom-up order:

\subsection{Binomial Coefficients}

We define the binomial coefficient $\Binomial{n}{m}$ by recursion equations in the usual way.
The consistency of the definition is proved automatically.

πHOLCONST
‹ €Binomial› : Ó ≠ Ó ≠ Ó 
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹	Binomial 0 0 = 1
‹ ±	(µm∑Binomial 0 (m+1) = 0)
‹ ±	(µn∑Binomial (n+1) 0 = 1)
‹ ±	(µn m∑ Binomial (n+1) (m+1) = Binomial n m + Binomial n (m+1))
∞

After the inclusion/exclusion principle, we turn to something  a little simpler, proving that if $A$ is a set of size $n$, then $A$ has $\Binomial{n}{m}$ subsets of size $m$.
In a related vein we also prove the binomial theorem (but apart from the algebraic facts about the binomial function that are used, the proofs are separate).

We then have a couple of useful lemmas about the factorial function which are used to prove the formula $\Binomial{m+n}{m} = (n+m)!/m!*n!$.

\subsection{Sampling}

If $A$ is a finite set of size $s$ say, there are $s^n$ ways of taking an ordered sample of $m$ not necessarily distinct elements of $A$ (``sampling with replacement'').
If the samples are required to be distinct, then there are no samples unless $s = m + n \ge n$, say, and then the number of samples is $(m+n)(m+n-1)\ldots (m+1)$ (``sampling without replacement'').
The following function gives this quantity as a function of $m$ and $n$.
 
πHOLCONST
‹ €DistinctSamples› : Ó ≠ Ó ≠ Ó
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ 	(µn∑ DistinctSamples n 0 = 1)
‹ ±	(µm n∑ DistinctSamples n (m+1) = (n+m+1) * DistinctSamples n m)
∞

The following block of theorems help deal with sampling and provide some further useful combinatorial facts.
The first in the block proves the existence of a polymorphic enumeration function assigning to each finite set $A$,
a function $\Enumerate{A}$ which maps the set of natural numbers less than $\Size{A}$ bijectively onto $A$.
This is used to prove a theorem about ``coverings'': let us say a set $B$ {\em covers} another set $A$, if there is a function $f$ and a natural number $m$ mapping $B$ to $A$ such that the inverse images $f^{-1}(y)$ as $y$ ranges over $A$ are all finite and of size $m$; in these circumstances, then if $A$ is finite, so is $B$ and $\Size{B} = m \times \Size{A}$.

These facts (together with earlier counting principles) are then used to prove the statements made above about sampling, in which we use lists to represent ordered samples. This representation fits in nicely with earlier results connecting lists and finite sets.

Determining probabilities in finite sample spaces is ``simply'' a matter of counting: if $S$ is finite sample space with $\Size{S} \not= 0$ and $X$ is a subset of $S$, then the probability that an event in $S$ belongs to $X$ is $\Size{X}/\Size{S}$.

The next theorem gives the well-known calculation that in a group of 23 people, the probability that at least two people have the same birthday is greater than $1/2$.
This is a simple consequence of the above theorems on sampling ($S$ and $S \ X$ being the set of samples of size 23 out of a set of size 365 with and without replacement respectively).
In section~\ref{ballot}, we do a harder example.

\subsection{Application: Bertrand's Ballot Theorem}\label{ballot}

In Bertrand's ballot problem a ballot is held between two candidates, North and South, say.
North beats South, the votes being counted one at a time by a single clerk.
The problem is to calculate the probability that at all times during the count, North had a majority over South.


The answer is the result of dividing the North's final majority by the total number of votes cast.
I.e., if the North receives $M$ votes and South $N$, the probability is $(M - N)/(M + N)$.

Following Feller~\cite{Feller68}, we represent the ballot problem using {\em walks} (also called ``paths'' in~\cite{Feller68}).
We define a {\em walk} of length $n$ starting at $x$ is a sequence of integers $s_i$ such that $s_0 = x$, $|s_{m+1} - s_m| = 1$ for $0 \le i < n$ and (for definiteness) $s_{m+1} = s_n$ for $m \ge n$.

πHOLCONST
‹ €Walk› : Ó ≠ ˙ ≠ (Ó ≠ ˙) SET
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ µn x s∑
‹	s ç Walk n x
‹ §	s 0 = x
‹ ±	(µm∑m < n ¥ Abs(s(m+1) - s(m)) = Ó˙ 1)
‹ ±	(µm∑n º m ¥ s m = s n)
∞

In talking about walks, we often identify a walk $s_i$ with the polygonal path obtained by joining the points $(i, s_i)$ in the plane. Under this identification a walk starting at $x$ of length $n$ begins at $(0, x)$, takes $n$ diagonal north-east or south-east steps and then heads directly east indefinitely.
The following definition captures the final $y$-value taken on by a walk.

πHOLCONST
‹ €WalkTo› : Ó ≠ ˙ ≠ ˙ ≠ (Ó ≠ ˙) SET
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ µn x y s∑
‹	s ç WalkTo n x y
‹ §	s ç Walk n x ± s n = y
∞

Walks satisfy a discrete version of the intermediate value theorem: if $x$, $y$ and $z$ are integers such that $z$ lies between $x$ and $y$ then any walk from $x$ to $y$ takes the value $z$ at some stage.



In the ballot problem, define $s_i$ to be the (possibly zero or negative) majority of North over South when the $i$-th vote is counted.
Then $s_i$ is a walk of length $M + N$ from $0$ to $M - N$ and any such walk corresponds to exactly one possible order in which to count the votes.

πHOLCONST
‹ €BallotCounts› : Ó ≠ Ó ≠ (Ó ≠ ˙) SET
˜¸¸¸¸¸¸
‹ µm n∑ BallotCounts m n = WalkTo (m + n) (Ó˙ 0) (Ó˙ m - Ó˙ n)
∞

Thus the probability we have to calculate is $x/s$, where $s$ is the total number of walks, $_i$, of length $M + N$ from $0$ to $M - N$, and where $x$ is the number of these that are {\em favourable}, i.e., that are such that $s_i > 0$ for $i > 0$.
For any $Q$, a walk of length $M + N$ from $Q$ to $Q + M - N$ is uniquely determined by the set of indices $s_i$ for which $s_{i+1} - s_i = 1$.
Thus the number of such walks is the number of ways of choosing $m$ numbers less than $M + N$, i.e., $s = \Binomial{M+N}{M}$.

To calculate the number of favourable walks, we use what Feller calls the {\em reflection principle}. This says that, if $i$ and $j$ are positive integers, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between walks of length $M+N$, $s_i$, from $i$ to $j$ which cross the $x$-axis and arbitrary walks of length $M+N$ from $-i$ to $j$. To see this one observes that, by the intermediate value theorem for walks, a walk, $t_i$, of the second sort must have $t_i = 0$ for some $i$; reflecting the initial negative segment of $t_i$ in the $x$-axis gives a walk $s_i$ of the first sort. This reflection defines the required one-to-one correspondence.

Now if $s_i$ is a favourable walk of length $M+N$ from $0$ to $M-N$ then $t_i = s_{i+1}$ defines a walk from $1$ to $M-N > 0$ which does not cross the $x$-axis.
From the reflection principle, we have that the number of such walks is $a = \Binomial{M+N-1}{M-1} - \Binomial{M+N-1}{M}$.
It then follows from a calculation using the definition of the binomial function in terms of factorials, that $x/s = (M-N)/(M+N)$.

The following block of theorems implements the proof sketched above.
