\section{INTRODUCTION}

This document is one of a suite of mathematical case studies in {\ProductHOL}.
It deals with some elementary number theory.

Topics currently covered include divisors and greatest common divisors, Euclid's algorithm, the infinitude of the primes, fundamental theorem of arithmetic,
divergence of the series of reciprocals of the primes.

There are also a few definitions and lemmas relating to general subrings of the real numbers.
These are used to define the subring of integers and the subfield of rational numbers.


\section{THE THEORY {\em numbers}}\label{theory}

\subsection{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Divisors in î}
We begin to develop the theory of divisors by first defining an infix relation, $\DividesName$, such that $\Divides{n}{m}$ iff. $m$ is a multiple of $n$.
 
=SML
declare_infix(200, "Divides");
¹HOLCONST
Ü Û$DividesÝ : î ­ î ­ BOOL
÷üüüüüü
Ü µn m· n Divides m ¤ ¶k· m = k * n
°
It is often convenient to reduce
=INLINEFT
n Divides m
=TEX
\ to
=INLINEFT
m Mod n = 0
=TEX
.
The following block of theorems provide this and several other useful facts, e.g., that {\em Divides} is a partial ordering, i.e., it is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.

\ThmsIII{

=TEX
}

We now specify the greatest common divisor function by requiring it to produce greatest lower bounds with respect to the divisor ordering.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛGcdÝ : î ­ î ­ î
÷üüüüüü
Ü µm n·	0 < m ± 0 < n
Ü ´	Gcd m n Divides m ± Gcd m n Divides n
Ü ± 	(µd·	d Divides m ± d Divides n
Ü	´	d Divides Gcd m n)
°

We will need to prove the consistency of the above definition.
Our approach is based on the one  which exhibits the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ as the smallest positive value of the form $am + bn$.
To follow that approach directly requires $a$ and $b$ to range over both positive and negative integers.
A slightly less symmetrical alternative is to take the g.c.d. to be the smallest positive value of the form $(am)\;Mod\;n$.
This works over the natural numbers and is the method we use.

Various useful lemmas about greatest common divisors are then proved culminating in the theorem that Euclid's algorithm computes them.

\ThmsIII{

}

Now we define the set of prime numbers:

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛPrimeÝ : î SET
÷üüüüüü
Ü Prime = {p | 1 < p ± µm n· p = m*n ´ m = 1 ² n = 1}
°
The first important fact we need about prime numbers states that a number is prime iff. it is greater than 1 and whenever it divides a product it divides one of the factors.
The right-to-left direction of this is simple.
It is for this the other direction that we needed to develop the theory of the g.c.d.

}

\subsection{Indexed Sums and Products in î}
A useful application of the set fold operation is to define the following indexed sum operation. Given an index set, $a$, and a function, $f$, assigning a number to each member of $a$,
=INLINEFT
IndSum‰N a f
=TEX
\ is the indexed sum $\sum_{x\in a}f(x)$, which is defined on any set $a$ in which $f$ has finite support.


¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛIndSum‰NÝ : 'a SET ­ ('a ­ î) ­ î
÷üüüüüü
Ü µf·	IndSum‰N {} f = 0
Ü ±	µx a·	a  Finite ± ³x  a
Ü	´	IndSum‰N ({x} À a) f = f x + IndSum‰N a f
°

We will write $\sum\,a\,f$ as shorthand for
=INLINEFT
IndSum‰N a f
=TEX
.
=SML
declare_alias("“", ¬IndSum‰N®);
=TEX
Similarly, we define indexed products:
=TEX
¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛIndProd‰NÝ : 'a SET ­ ('a ­ î) ­ î
÷üüüüüü
Ü µf·	IndProd‰N {} f = 1
Ü ±	µx a·	a  Finite ± ³x  a
Ü	´	IndProd‰N ({x} À a) f = f x * IndProd‰N a f
°

We will write $\prod\,a\,f$ as shorthand for
=INLINEFT
IndProd‰N a f
=TEX
.
=SML
declare_alias("", ¬IndProd‰N®);
=TEX

The theorems about sums and products comprise various generalities that make the definitions useful in the common cases.
Then as an exercise for the definitions, we prove the ``division by 3 rule'' which says that a number is divisible by 3 iff. the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by 3.

\ThmsIII{
=GFT
IndSum‰N_consistent
ind_sum_î_def
ind_sum_î_0_thm
ind_sum_î_local_thm

}{%
=GFT

ind_prod_î_0_thm
=TEX
}{%
=GFT
ind_prod_î_local_thm
div_3_rule_thm1
div_3_rule_thm
=TEX
}

Using indexed products, we can now give Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes:

\ThmsIII{}{
=GFT
prime_infinite_thm
=TEX
}{}

\subsection{Unique Factorisation in î}
The next group of theorems in the script prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, i.e., the statement that any positive natural number can be written uniquely as a product of prime powers.

The existence proof is standard, although it is very convenient to give an explicit formula for the exponent of a prime in the factorisation ({\em exponent\_thm}). This makes the uniqueness part of the argument very simple.

divides_cancel_thm
exponent_thm
unique_factorisation_thm
=TEX
}{%
=GFT
prime_divisors_unique_thm
prime_divisors_finite_thm
=TEX
}
\subsection{Divergence of the Series of Prime Reciprocals}
The next block of theorems lead up to the proof that the sum $\sum_p 1/p$ taken over all primes p diverges.
This is done using essentially the argument given in Hardy and Wright~\cite{Hardy78}.
It is convenient to define the notion of a square-free number, i.e., a number that is not divisible by a square other than 1.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛSquareFreeÝ : î SET
÷üüüüüü
Ü µm· m  SquareFree ¤ µn· n^2 Divides m ´ n = 1
°
We first derive several facts about square-free numbers.
In particular we show that a number is square-free iff. it is not divisible by the square of any prime.
This shows that the non-zero exponents in the prime factorisation of a square-free number are all equal to 1.
Using this, we show that given any finite set of primes $P$, the set of square-free number whose prime divisors lie in $P$ is finite and has $2^\Size{P}$ elements.
We then show that every number can be written as a product $n^2\times d$ where $d$ is square-free.

\ThmsIII{
=GFT
square_free_0_less_thm
square_free_prime_thm
factorisation_square_free_thm

}{

square_free_finite_size_thm
=TEX
}{
=GFT
square_free_1_thm
square_free_divisor_thm
square_free_divisor_thm1
=TEX
}

We now give a series of theorems that build up to the proof that
$\sum_p 1/p$ taken over prime $p \le n$
is unbounded as $n$ tends to infinity.
The argument is that of~\cite{Hardy78}[Theorem 19] adapted to fit into the typed framework of HOL.

Consider a finite set of primes, $P$ and a positive natural number $n$. If $m \le n^2$, then either all prime divisors of $m$ are in $P$ or not. We will estimate the number of $m$ falling under each of the two cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item
If all the prime divisors of $m$ lie in $P$, $m$ can be written as $m = k^2d$ where $k \le n$ and where $d$ is a square-free number whose prime divisors lie in $P$.
There are at most $n$ choices for $k$ and $2^{\Size{P}}$ so there are at most $n2^{\Size{P}}$ such $m$.
\item
If $m$ is divisible by a prime $q$ that is not in $P$, we have $m = kq$ for some $k \le \Div{n^2}{q}$. 
The number of such $m$ is therefore
$\sum_q \Div{n^2}{q}$ taken over all prime $q$ with $q \not\in P$ and $q \le n^2$.
\end{itemize}

Let $Q$ be the set of primes $q \le n^2$ which are not in $P$, then, as any $m \le n^2$ falls under one of the two cases, one has:
\begin{eqnarray}
n^2 &\le&  n2^{\Size{P}} +
	\sum_{q \in Q}
	\Div{n^2}{q}
\end{eqnarray}

Putting $n = 2^{\Size{P}+1}$ this gives:
\begin{eqnarray}
2^{2\Size{P}+2} &\le&  2^{2\Size{P}+1} +
	\sum_{q \in Q}
	\Div{2^{2\Size{P}+2}}{q}
\end{eqnarray}

Whence, subtracting $2^{2\Size{P}+1}$ from both sides and then, observing that $\Div{i}{q} \le i/q$, and dividing through by $2^{2\Size{P}+2}$, one has:
\begin{eqnarray}
2^{2\Size{P}+1} &\le& \sum_{q \in Q} \Div{2^{2\Size{P}+2}}{q}\\
1/2 &\le& \sum_{q \in Q} 1/q
\end{eqnarray}

I.e., given any finite set of primes $P$, taking $Q$ to be the set of primes q that are not in $P$ and that satisfy $q \le 2^{2\Size{P}+2}$, the sum of reciprocals of the elements of $Q$ is greater than $1/2$.
That the sum of the series of reciprocals of the primes diverges follows by an easy induction (given any initial subsequence of the sequence of primes for which the sum or reciprocals is $s$, say, the above argument gives a longer initial subsequence whose sum is $s +1/2$).
The following block of theorems implement the above proof.

\subsection{Real Integral Domains}
In general, an integral domain is a ring without zero divisors.
As we are only concerned with subrings of the reals here, any subring of the reals is an integral domain. 
 
¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛRealIDÝ : ¯ SET SET
÷üüüüüü
Ü µA· A  RealID ¤
Ü	î¯ 1  A
Ü ±	(µx y·x  A ± y  A ´ x + y  A)
Ü ±	(µx·x  A ´ ~x  A)
Ü ±	(µx y·x  A ± y  A ´ x * y  A)
°

The domain of (rational) integers comprises the intersection of all real integral domains:

¹HOLCONST
Ü Ûú‰RÝ : ¯ SET
÷üüüüüü
Ü ú‰R = ¥RealID
°
=SML
declare_alias("ú", ¬ú‰R®);
=TEX
To get started, we prove that ¯ is a real integral domain, as is the intersection of any family of real integral domains, and so in particular is ú, the intersection of all real integral domains.
We then show that ú is precisely the image of the type ú of integers under the injection ú¯:

\ThmsII{
=GFT
¯_real_i_d_thm
¥_real_i_d_thm
=TEX
}{%
=GFT
ú_real_i_d_thm
ú_thm
=TEX
}

\subsection{Real Fields}
A real field is a real integral domain that is closed under taking reciprocals of non-zero elements.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛRealFieldÝ : ¯ SET SET
÷üüüüüü
Ü µA· A  RealField ¤
Ü	A  RealID
Ü ±	(µx·x  A \ {î¯ 0} ´ x ›-›1  A)
°

The field of rational numbes is the intersection of all real fields.

¹HOLCONST
Ü Û%bbQ%‰RÝ : ¯ SET
÷üüüüüü
Ü %bbQ%‰R = ¥RealField
°

Following a similar pattern to the last section, we prove that ¯ is a real field, as is the intersection of any family of real fields, in particular, %bbQ%, the intersection of all real fields.
We prove that ú is a subset of %bbQ%.
An explicit formula for the set %bbQ% is given in the next section.

\ThmsII{
=GFT
¯_real_field_thm
¥_real_field_thm
=TEX
}{
=GFT
rat_real_i_d_thm
ú_€_rat_thm
=TEX
}

=SML
declare_alias("%bbQ%", ¬%bbQ%‰R®);
=TEX
\subsection{Fields of Fractions}
The field of fractions of a set $A$, (typically an integral domain) is the intersection of all fields that contain $A$.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛFieldOfFractionsÝ : ¯ SET ­ ¯ SET
÷üüüüüü
Ü µA· FieldOfFractions A = ¥{K | K  RealField ± A € K}
°
We prove that the field of fractions of any set is indeed a real field and that %bbQ% is the field of fractions of ú.
We then show that if $A$ is an integral domain, then its field of fractions does indeed comprise precisely the set of fractions $a/b$ with $a, b \in A$ and $b \not = 0$.
Using this we can derive an explicit formula for the set %bbQ%.


\ThmsII{
=GFT

\section{Irrationality of Quadratic Surds}
We prove that any quadratic surd that is not an integer is irrational, and in particular, that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
The proof is as follows:
if $m^2 = kn^2$ for any natural numbers $k$, $m$ and $n$ with $k$ positive and $n > 1$, then any prime divisor of $n$ is also a prime divisor of $m$.
Thus, by infinite descent, the only solutions of this equation with $k$ and $n$ positive have $n = 1$, i.e., the only solutions are when $k = m^2$ is a square.
Thus to prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational it suffices to show that it is not an integer.

\section{Arithmetic {\it modulo} a Prime}
The next block of results develop some basic facts about arithemetic {\it modulo} prime numbers, e.g., the existence of multiplicative inverses {\it modulo} primes.
The block concludes with Wilson's theorem: if $1 < p$, then $p$ is prime iff. $(p-1)!$ is congruent to $-1$ {\it modulo} $p$.
We state this in term of the $\ModName$ operator on the natural numbers so that it becomes ``$p$ is prime iff. $\Mod{(p-1)!}{p} = p - 1$''.
