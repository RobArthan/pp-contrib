OpenTheory for ProofPower
=========================

This is a very experimental implementation of an OpenTheory Reader and
Writer for ProofPower. It needs ProofPower 3.1w1 or later. Thw writer
targets OpenTheory draft version 6. The Reader should be able to input
any OpenTheory version 5 or later.
